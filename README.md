2. Choose the downloaded `FarmersMarketDatabase.sql` file from the folder you downloaded it to. The script includes schema creation and will create a schema called `farmers_market`, so you don't need to enter a target schema.

3. Scroll down and click the "Start Import" button.
4. After the database has restored, you can open a new SQL tab (use the first icon, which is labeled with the word SQL and +) and start writing and running queries.
